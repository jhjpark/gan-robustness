# Training GANs on 1D and 2D Distributions

This code is based on these two repositories.

[Supplementary MMD GAN Implementation](https://github.com/yanglj123456/MMD-GAN-1D)

The code provided in `gan_1d.py` and `mmd.py` was drawn directly from these sources. These files were revised to create `gan_nd.py`, `gan_nd_conditional.py`, and `gan_satellite.py` to extend GANs to multiple dimensions, train conditional GANs, and use GANs to produce new satellite images.
