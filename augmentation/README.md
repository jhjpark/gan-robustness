# Augmentation

This directory contains the code used to train a new CNN on the SpaceNet data with data augmentation. The code was ran in Google Colab. The code was iterated on from the initial handout code given in Problem Set 2 Question 3. The handout code loaded the data, defined the model, and trained the model. I added new augmentations and retrained the models with these new augmentations. Furthermore, I added more code to calculate invariance metrics.
