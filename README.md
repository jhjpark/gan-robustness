# Using GANs for Data Augmentation in Satellite Data

The code used for this project is contained in this repostiory. This includes code for each of the three parts of the project. 

`augmentation`: This folder contains code for training models with augmented data.

`distribution`: This folder contains code for training GANs to model 1D and 2D distributions.

`pre-trianed`: This folder contains code for running the a pre-trained ResNet model on satellite images.

Each subdirectory has its own corresponding README with more details about the contents and the correspodning sources used.
