# Using GANs for Data Augmentation in Satellite-Based CNN Models

The code used for this project is contained in this repostiory. This includes code for each of the three parts of the project. 

`augmentation`: This folder contains code for training models with augmented data.

`distribution`: This folder contains code for training GANs to model 1D and 2D distributions.

`pre-trianed`: This folder contains code for running the a pre-trained ResNet model on satellite images.

Each subdirectory has its own corresponding README with more details about the contents and the correspodning sources used.
