# Pre-Trained Models

The code in this folder runs a pre-trained ResNet model and ridge regression. The code was ran in Google Colab. [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) was referenced to load in the pre-trained weights from ResNet. The code to load in the data was drawn from the Problem Set 2 Question 3 handout code. The rest is original code.
